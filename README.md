# G20 Data Vizualization

The G20 is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19 countries and the European Union (EU). Founded in 1999 with the aim to discuss policy pertaining to the promotion of international financial stability. With this project, our aim is to use G20 2010-2018 data, and bring out intersting insights in terms of Educational, Healthcare and Military spending of the G20 countries. We will use GDP as the financial metric for our analysis.
